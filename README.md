# Repository Template

[contributing]: https://github.com/invoker-bot/repository-template/CONTRIBUTING.md

A repository template for common open-source project standardization (README, CONTRIBUTING, GitHub templates, etc).

I found sometimes it's hard to start a project especially for single developers or small organizations. It is tired even just writing documentations, configurations and workflows.  Fortunately, there are much similar works in many projects. So I include most of essential files that basically requires a simple open project's needs. Then, we can just clone this repository as a starting template when we want to create a new project, which simplifies the project starting process wasting time in past.

We hope this template enables you to write better documentation for your own projects! Any contributions are welcome from all.
